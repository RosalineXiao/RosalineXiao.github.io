      <description>LIMERA: Professional camera for easy storage LIMERA is a portable camera that proposes a new method of camera storage without compromising professionalty, It implements a swivel body that allows the camera to be transformed into a smaller cylinder which is much easier to store in bags and carry around.
Professional cameras are big, bulky and have a weird shape, whereas LIMERA cuts the bulk of raditional cameres.The project originates from my hoby ofphotography, where l find traditional cameras hard to fit in my back pack.</description>

      <description>Ferrofluid Loudspeakers SPACE CUBE is a futuristic loudspeaker that has built-in audio visualization. It features ferrofluid, which dances and changes shape in rhythm with the music that is being played. The loudspeaker has an elegant and futuristic design.
The idea comes from one of my school projects where we discuss and experiment with different materials. Ferrofluid is a special liquid as it is magnetic,so its unique magnetic properties can be used to achieve stunning effects in designing a product.</description>

      <description>Introduction In 2021, there were approximately 973 thousand males and 561 thousand females aged 16 to 44 living alone in the United Kingdom[1]. They crave love and emotional support. As a way to solve the loneliness problem, many young people living alone are eager to keep pets to accompany them, but they cannot due to various reasons. Many of them then choose to keep plants and regard plants as living companions.</description>

      <description>LOGGER: Contribute to meteorological studies while hiking LOGGER is a smart water bottle that has multiple in-built sensors for environmental measurements. Hikers are able to contribute to scientific research by trekking to remote areas that lack internet connection and weather monitoring. The sensors will collect data while hikers are trekking, and upload the data once it connects to the internet. This allows scientist to collect data first-hand from hikers, data gathered from some of the most unstudied and remote places on Earth.</description>

      <description>Introduction UN Goal background
The goal for this project is UN Goal No.11
SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND COMMUNITIES
The goal target is:
By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport.
To achieve these goals, we decided to improve the bus ride experience by designing with buses in public transport. We wanted to provide a more convenient ride for passengers, and we found that tourists, as a group unfamiliar with the local environment, prefer to travel by taxi.</description>

      <description>THE BRIEF WHY CLIMATE CHANGE? Climate change happens because large amounts of greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere as a result of many human activities worldwide, including, most importantly, burning fossil fuels for electricity generation, heating and transport. Climate change can alter our energy generation potential and energy needs.
WHY IT MATTERS? The impacts of climate change are increasing in frequency. People are at risk of overheating in their homes.</description>
