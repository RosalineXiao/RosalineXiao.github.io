      <description>Ferrofluid Loudspeakers Ferrofluid is a new type of nanomaterial that appears as a black, smooth liquid. Its biggest characteristic is that it has both fluidity and magnetism, which makes it similar to flowing metal. The shape and position of the ferrofluid can be controlled by magnetic force, especially under strong magnetic fields, where the ferrofluid will split into many spikes, which changes its physical appearance in a way that contradicts human intuition.</description>

      <description>Introduction In 2021, there were approximately 973 thousand males and 561 thousand females aged 16 to 44 living alone in the United Kingdom[1]. They crave love and emotional support. As a way to solve the loneliness problem, many young people living alone are eager to keep pets to accompany them, but they cannot due to various reasons. Many of them then choose to keep plants and regard plants as living companions.</description>

      <description>Introduction UN Goal background
The goal for this project is UN Goal No.11
SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND COMMUNITIES
The goal target is:
By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport.
To achieve these goals, we decided to improve the bus ride experience by designing with buses in public transport. We wanted to provide a more convenient ride for passengers, and we found that tourists, as a group unfamiliar with the local environment, prefer to travel by taxi.</description>

      <description>Hunt Statement Background and initial Hunt statement In this research, we focus on the process of washing clothes and study the impact of clothes washing on the environment. A scoping tool: The 5Ws and 1H (Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How) is used to investigate a certain brief or context.
Pet owners were intrigued and decided to study. I myself am a pet owner, and there are many pet owners across the world.</description>
