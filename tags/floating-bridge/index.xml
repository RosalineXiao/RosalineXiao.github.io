      <description>EzPorter: Fast deployable floating bridge design for rescue EzPorter is portable and fast-deployable bridge system that can be used during foods. It implements diferent modules that can be utilited in diferent combinations to meet different use cases. It can also function as road barriers when not in use.
The idea of EzPorter comes from my own experience in floods. My home town is prone to big food in the summer, and I have experenced being stranded and not able to move due to floods.</description>
