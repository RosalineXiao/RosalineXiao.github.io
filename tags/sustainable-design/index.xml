      <description>Introduction This project is a group work with three other students.
The project is conducted in collaboration with TPXimpact, a digital transformation company based in the UK, supporting organisations to build a better future for people, places and the planet.
Team Members: Xiangyu Xiao (me), Mingjin Yang, Wen Zhou, Yifan Shi
Within the group, we generally use the Scrum Framework to arrange our project, because Scrum is an agile development methodology, which can double the development efficiency of the team and maximize the role of the team compared to the development method under the waterfall process; It can shorten the development cycle and improve the efficiency of project delivery(Leaders and Sennett, 2022).</description>
