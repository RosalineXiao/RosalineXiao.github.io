      <description>Ferrofluid Loudspeakers SPACE CUBE is a futuristic loudspeaker that has built-in audio visualization. It features ferrofluid, which dances and changes shape in rhythm with the music that is being played. The loudspeaker has an elegant and futuristic design.
The idea comes from one of my school projects where we discuss and experiment with different materials. Ferrofluid is a special liquid as it is magnetic,so its unique magnetic properties can be used to achieve stunning effects in designing a product.</description>
