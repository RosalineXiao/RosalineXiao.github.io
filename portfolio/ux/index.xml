      <description>Introduction In 2021, there were approximately 973 thousand males and 561 thousand females aged 16 to 44 living alone in the United Kingdom[1]. They crave love and emotional support. As a way to solve the loneliness problem, many young people living alone are eager to keep pets to accompany them, but they cannot due to various reasons. Many of them then choose to keep plants and regard plants as living companions.</description>

      <description>Introduction UN Goal background
The goal for this project is UN Goal No.11
SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND COMMUNITIES
The goal target is:
By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport.
To achieve these goals, we decided to improve the bus ride experience by designing with buses in public transport. We wanted to provide a more convenient ride for passengers, and we found that tourists, as a group unfamiliar with the local environment, prefer to travel by taxi.</description>
